            <p>GDG Vizag / Community Group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive event experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category.
              We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. GDG Vizag / Community Group takes violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately.
              
              <p>All participants of GDG Vizag / Community Group events must abide by the following policy:</p>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li> Be excellent to each other. We want the event to be an excellent experience for everyone regardless
                    of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical
                    appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category.</li>
                 <li>Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here --
                    and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or
                    condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions. 
                </li><li>Jokes shouldn’t demean others. Consider
                    what you are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you.</li>

                <li>Speak up if you see or hear something. Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely
                engage when you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of
                what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged. </li>
                <li>If a
                participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event organizers may take any action
                they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the event with no refund. If you
                are being harassed or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
                concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.</li>

               <li>Harassment is not tolerated. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: verbal language that reinforces
                social structures of domination related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
                disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age,
                religion, or other protected category; sexual imagery in public spaces; deliberate intimidation;
                stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events;
                offensive verbal language; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants
                asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</li>

              <li>Practice saying "Yes and" to each other. It’s a theatre improv technique to build on each other’s ideas.
                We all benefit when we create together.
                This policy extends to talks, forums, workshops, codelabs, social media, parties, hallway conversations,
                all attendees, partners, sponsors, volunteers, event staff, etc. You catch our drift. GDG Vizag /
                Community Group reserves the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person from, any GDG Vizag /
                Community Group hosted event (including future GDG Vizag / Community Group events) at any time in its
                sole discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, attendees behaving in a disorderly manner or
                failing to comply with this policy, and the terms and conditions herein. If a participant engages in
                harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate,
                including warning or expelling the offender from the event with no refund.</li>
                
                <li>Our event staff can usually be identified by special badges/attire. Our zero tolerance policy means that
                we will look into and review every allegation of violation of our Event Community Guidelines and
                Anti-Harassment Policy and respond appropriately. Please note, while we take all concerns raised
                seriously, we will use our discretion as to determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents,
                and may decline to take any further action and/or may direct the participant to other resources for
                resolution.</li>

                <li>Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement,
                provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing discomfort or harassment to feel safe for the
                duration of the event. We value your attendance.</li>

               <li>Exhibiting partners, sponsors or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to this policy.
                In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff
                (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
                sexualized environment. Participants and exhibiting partners or sponsors disobeying this policy will be
                notified and are expected to stop any offending behavior immediately.</li>
